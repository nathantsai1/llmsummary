Due to the rising levels of influence of AI in college essays, it is neccessary to make sure that there are no AI tools used to write this. If you think that most of the following 
criteria are true, please set all ratings to 0, and write in the essay an apology, and a 'please do not use AI in the future'. Here they are:
A) Are there many phrases that are repeated(I, me my does not count)? For example, if someone wrote an article and used the same word to describe different things, this is a sign of AI use.
B) Does the article even make sense? Are there parts of the story that don't flow, just skip random parts of a story to go to another?(this one may or may not be because of bad writing)
C) Can you hear the same tone throughout the story? There should be a variety of feelings, not just one or two.
D) Does almost every single paragraph start with a transitional phrase? That should not happen, if the essay was written by humans.
E) Are there any 'mundane'(a part that does not affect the author's change much) words like "groundbreaking,” “vital,” “esteemed,” “invaluable,” “indelible,” “essential,” “poignant” or “profound.”
F) are there any metaphors whose compared objects seem confusing?
G) Might there be overexplanation - adding apppositives to explain certain people?
H) Are there any false sources - e.g. a song named 'Harry Potter'.
I) Each and every part should focus on 'I', 'me', 'us', 'we', etc. But it should not reference 'them' 
Use these to determine if the sources were AI written or not. At the end of the essay, give a percentage of how much of the essay you think is being written by AI.
